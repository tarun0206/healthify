					<h1>Diabetes</h1>
					<h3>What is diabetes?</h3>
					<p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into
						energy. <br> Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it
						into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release
						insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as
						energy. <br> With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it
						should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood
						sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as
						heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p><br>
					<h3>Types of Diabetes?</h3>
					<p>There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while
						pregnant).</p>
					<h4>Type 1 Diabetes</h4>
					<p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by
						mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people
						who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually
						diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take
						insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>
					<h4>Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
					<p>With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal
						levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is
						usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may
						not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk.
						Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as: <br>
						Losing Weight <br>
						Eating Healthy Food <br>
						Being Active <br>
					</p>
					<h4>Gestational Diabetes</h4>
					<p>Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, it increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>
					<h4>Prediabetes</h4>
					<p>In the United States, 96 million adults—more than 1 in 3—have prediabetes. More than 8 in 10 of them don’t know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But there’s good news. If you have prediabetes, a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program can help you take healthy steps to reverse it.</p>
